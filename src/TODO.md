# TODO

* Redo the homepage layout with the new idea
* Figure out how to omit ".html" from the end of files
* See if there is any way to handle includes
* Crop the images that Jeff sent over
* Re-do the layout for the homepage
* Create a favicon
* Extract a palette from the iStockPhoto images I grabbed
* Find an image of security that isn't a lock - ask on the DH Slack channel
* Really need to add a margin back to the bottom of the P tag
* Wire-up the carousel
* Figure out how to make the hero more interesting
* Create a copy of the specific logo, but inverted
* Get the top of "Custom Electronics" and "MODULAR" to line up better
* I think the unique manufacturable devices count should be a monospaced font (or use tabular characters)
* Once we have a color palette, use it to color the unique manufacturable devices box
* Do the footer
* Change the "Managed Supply Chain" to be a grid. The title could go in the top-left quadrant.
* Make the homepage responsive
