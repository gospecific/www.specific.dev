        Specific is a service for specifying, configuring, and purchasing custom electronics in quantities from one to thousands.
        You can use it with or without electrical engineering expertice. Let's explore how our system works and how it can help
        you efficiently create an amazing device.

            Building with an off-the-shelf board is for chumps. You are the domain expert.
            You know what features you want in your board and you know that anything additional
            will just increase the cost, complexity, and power consumption.

          <h2><span class='flow__ordinal'>02</span> Select Your Microcontroller</h2>

          <p>
            All boards start with the microcontroller. Typically, the choice comes down to the intersection
            of processing power, power consumption, onboard radios (you can always add more though), and what
            operating system you want to use. You can select a microcontroller from our catalog or use our
            wizard to find the perfect one for your project.

            Features add additional functionality to your board. Our catalog of features includes sensors, actuators,

          <p>
            Add accessories, like power supplies, antannaes, or SD cards. If you've developed your firmware already,
            upload it here and we will flash it to each board during manufacturing.

          <p>
            When this step is complete, you will have created a specification for your exact board.
